	"tut.d2": "And remember, in the §eARENA§r...",
	"tut.d3": "It's kill or BE killed.",
	"tut.d4": "...well, as much as I want to say that,",
	"tut.d5": "You do have the option to show §eMERCY§r.",
	"tut.d6": "But trust me, it's not worth it.",
	"tut.e1": "Anyhow, lemme teach you the basics of the §eARENA§r.",
	"tut.e2": "Every character has 3 abilities.",
	"tut.e3": "Why don't you try out your §bPRIMARY ABILITY§r first?",
	"tut.e4": "Hold it and right-click!",
	"tut.e5": "It costs §bMANA§r to use, but your §bMANA§r regenerates over time.",
	"tut.f1": "Then, let's practice your aim on these dummies!",
	"tut.f2.1": "Impressive!",
	"tut.f2.2": "Not bad!",
	"tut.f2.3": "Hmmm...",
	"tut.f3.1": "You're excellent at aiming those bones!",
	"tut.f3.2": "To maximise your damage, you need to hit all of them!",
	"tut.f3.3": "It might be hard to use, but you'll get used to it!",
	"tut.g1": "Now, check out your §eSECONDARY ABILITY§r!",
	"tut.g2": "It charges over time!",
	"tut.g3": "You can use it whenever it's fully §eCHARGED§r!",
	"tut.g4": "§eSECONDARY ABILITIES§r usually have some special uses.",
	"tut.g5": "These blue bones, for example...",
	"tut.g5e1": "Actually, I don't need to tell you!",
	"tut.g5e2": "You should open your §eINVENTORY§r and check the §eITEM DESCRIPTION§r!",
	"tut.g6.1": "Very clever...",
	"tut.g6.2": "As you can see, you can avoid them by standing still!",
	"tut.g6.3": "As the §eITEM DESCRIPTION§r says, you can only hit moving targets!",
	"tut.g7": "If you're ever unsure what an ability does, just check the §eITEM DESCRIPTION§r!",
	"tut.g8": "So, let's move on.",
	"tut.h1": "Remember, just like you can attack your enemy...",
	"tut.h2": "Your enemy can also attack you.",
	"tut.h3": "See your §eHP§r bar up there?",
	"tut.h4": "If you get hit, You lose §eHP§r.",
	"tut.h5": "And if your §eHP§r reaches zero...",
	"tut.h6": "You DIE.",
	"tut.h7": "Surely you don't want that to happen, right?",
	"tut.h8": "So now let's practice §eDODGING§r.",
	"tut.h9": "Stay focused, I ain't holding back!",
	"tut.h13.1": "Not a scratch, huh?",
	"tut.h13.2": "You dodged most of them.",
	"tut.h13.3": "You nearly died.",
	"tut.i1.1": "Impressive.",
	"tut.i1.2": "Great!",
	"tut.i1.3": "Lucky one.",
	"tut.i2": "Finally, there's your §cDETERMINATION§r bar.",
	"tut.i3": "You gain §cDETERMINATION§r by dealing damage to enemies.",
	"tut.i3e1": "And when you're filled with §cDETERMINATION§r...",
	"tut.i4": "You can use your §cDETERMINATION ABILITY§r.",
	"tut.i5": "Try it out, won'tcha?",
	"tut.i6": "Very Well.",
	"tut.i7": "Now you should be prepared to fight in the arena!",
	"tut.i8": "Oh, and one last thing...",
	"tut.j1": "Don't lose your §6WILL TO FIGHT§r in the arena.",
	"tut.j2": "Depending on how well you're fighting...",
	"tut.j3": "You §6WILL§r will increase or decrease.",
	"tut.j4": "If your §6WILL§r is high enough, You can regain §eHP§r and §cDETERMINATION§r.",
	"tut.j5": "But if it's very low...",
	"tut.j6": "Others can §eSPARE§r you.",
	"tut.j6e1": "See that last item in your hotbar? That's your §eSPARE ABILITY§r.",
	"tut.j6e2": "If you see someone with §eYELLOW PARTICLES§r around them,",
	"tut.j7": "You can §eSPARE§r them, they get removed from the battle...",
	"tut.j8": "And the battle ends peacefully.",
	"tut.j9": "DON'T do that.",
	"tut.j10": "I'm only telling you that because of obligation.",
	"tut.k1": "But anyway, I guess this is the end of the tutorial!",
	"tut.k2": "Have FUN in the arena!",
	"tut.k3": "And remember, if you forget the rules...",
	"tut.k4": "I'll be here for you.",
	"tut.k5": "Cya!",
	
	"stut.d1": "Howdy!",
	"stut.d2": "Hope you're enjoying the arena!",
	"stut.d3": "This is a §eTUTORIAL ROOM§r, you will unlock more of these as you play more games!",
	"stut.d4": "You can learn some more game mechanics here, and in this room...",
	"stut.f5": "We'll %1$d",
	"stut.r1": "Let's %1$d",

	"stut.r1.1": "Did you know that every character has a §ePASSIVE ABILITY§r?",
	"stut.r1.2": "You can find it in the §eARMOR§r slot of your §eINVENTORY§r!",
	"stut.r1.3": "As the name tells you, you don't need to use them in the match.",
	"stut.r1.4": "These are abilities that trigger passively.",
	"stut.r1.5": "They won't impact the gameplay of a character too much, but knowing these abilities definitely will help!",
	
	"stut.r2.0": "talk about §cDETERMINATION ABILITIES§r!",
	"stut.r2.1.1": "It appears you've yet to use one, but...",
	"stut.r2.1.2": "Since you've already used one, you probably know that...",
	"stut.r2.2": "Determination abilities, §cDT ABILITY§r for short,",
	"stut.r2.3": "They're quite powerful!",
	"stut.r2.4": "While you can use them for your own advantage, it's also important to watch out for enemies' DT ability.",
	"stut.r2.5": "If an enemy is filled with DT, you'll see §cRED§r §cPARTICLES§r around them!",
	"stut.r2.6": "So if the enemy has those red particles, you better watch out!",
	"stut.r2.7": "It means they are ready to use their DT ability anytime.",
	"stut.r2.8": "Your DT ability can be the key of winning a battle, so make good use of it!",
	"stut.r2.e1.1": "You have used your §cDT§r ability %1$d times.",
	"stut.r2.e1.2": "You have used your §cDT§r ability %1$d times. Impressive!",
	
	"stut.r3.0": "talk about §eCANCELING§r an ability.",
	"stut.r3.1": "There are some abilities that take time to finish their full effect.",
	"stut.r3.2": "For example, Sans' Dodge and Undyne's Block both last for 3 seconds.",
	"stut.r3.3": "But you can also cancel that ability before it ends.",
	"stut.r3.4": "If you §echange your selected item§r to a different one, you will §ecancel§r the ability you were using.",
	"stut.r3.5": "So only do that when you want to cancel the ability...",
	"stut.r3.6": "You might want to do that because these abilities can slow you down.",
	"stut.r3.7": "Also, you can cancel other player's abilities with some debuff abilities...",
	"stut.r3.8": "Like with Asgore's stunned debuff and Frisk's infatuated debuff.",
	"stut.r3.e0": "You have to choose a character to use this button!",
	"stut.r3.e1": "None of the abilities of your character can be canceled.",
	"stut.r3.e2": "The following abilities of your character can be canceled: %1$d.",
	
	"stut.r4.0": "talk about §eHEALING§r.",
	"stut.r4.1": "You'll get injured in the arena, so you should also know how to heal your HP back up.",
	"stut.r4.2": "In order to §eHEAL§r, you need to be out of battle.",
	"stut.r4.3": "That is when you didn't attack nor take damage in the last 5 seconds.",
	"stut.r4.4": "Once you're out of battle, you'll heal 1 HP every 5 seconds.",
	"stut.r4.5": "That's pretty slow, ain't it? So if you want to get back as soon as possible...",
	"stut.r4.6": "There is also a way to §eFAST HEAL§r.",
	"stut.r4.7": "If you press the §eSNEAK§r key and don't move, you will start healing §e10§r times faster.",
	"stut.r4.8": "This doesn't come without a price though, §eFAST HEAL§r will also drain 5% §6WILL§r per HP healed.",
	"stut.r4.9": "Normal healing instead will only drain 1% §6WILL§r per HP healed.",
	"stut.r4.10": "So decide on your own, depending on the situation §6WILL POWER§r might be more valuable than §eHIT POINTS§r!",
	
	"stut.r5.0": "talk about the §eELIMINATION BONUS§r!",
	"stut.r5.1": "By now you should know, that in this world...",
	"stut.r5.2": "It's kill or be killed.",
	"stut.r5.3": "I mean look, you can even get a bonus by killing people!",
	"stut.r5.4": "By Default, whenever you eliminate someone, you'll regain 20% §6WILL§r, §cDT§r and §eHP§r.",
	"stut.r5.5": "So don't be afraid going into fights, it's always worth it.",

	"stut.r5.7": "...",
	"stut.r5.8": "Well, I guess I'm also obligated to tell you that...",
	"stut.r5.9": "Since it is called §eELIMINATION BONUS§r and not KILL BONUS...",

	"stut.r5.11": "Sometimes I REALLY hate this job.",
	
	"stut.r6.0": "talk about the §6WILL TO FIGHT§r!",
	"stut.r6.1": "You know, the arena really doesn't welcome cowards.",
	"stut.r6.2": "Why? Because they don't have the §6WILL TO FIGHT§r.",
	"stut.r6.3": "If you avoid battle and choose to hide, your §6WILL§r starts decreasing.",
	"stut.r6.4": "To be specific, this starts when you didn't hit any attacks for the last 30 seconds.",
	"stut.r6.5": "If you don't get into a battle for over 60 seconds, you'll even start to §eGLOW§r...",
	"stut.r6.6": "So you can't hide from enemies anymore.",
	"stut.r6.7": "Not only does Willpower help you heal up and save you from being spared,",
	"stut.r6.8": "You will also get punished when it is too low.",
	"stut.r6.9": "If your §6WILL§r is lower than 0%%, your speed will get slower.",
	"stut.r6.10": "The lower your will, the slower your speed.",
	"stut.r6.11": "Sounds terrible, right?",
	"stut.r6.12": "So get rid of those annoying pacifists before that happens.",
	
	"stut.r7.0": "talk about §eMELEE ATTACKS§r!",
	"stut.r7.1": "Here in the underground, magic is way more prevalent than any physical attacks.",
	"stut.r7.2": "Except the humans, they do use weapons instead of magical abilities.",
	"stut.r7.3": "However, there is a way for you to melee your opponent.",
	"stut.r7.4": "If you're not holding any item, you can throw a §ePUNCH§r.",
	"stut.r7.5": "By §eleft-clicking§r your enemy, you can knock them back, but it won't deal any damage.",
	"stut.r7.6": "It's very weak, but this can still be useful in some circumstances!",
	"stut.r7.7": "Just note doing so does lower your §6WILL§r a little bit.",
	"stut.r7.8": "Just a little. It won't hurt unless you do it too often.",
	
	"stut.r8.0": "talk about §eSOULS§r!",
	"stut.r8.1": "Souls are the very essence of one's being.",
	"stut.r8.2": "In certain gamemodes, you can harvest them by eliminating an enemy!",
	"stut.r8.3": "They can either be an important objective for winning the game, or...",
	"stut.r8.4": "You can §eCONSUME§r it for a temporary buff.",
	"stut.r8.5": "It will make you immune to debuffs and also give you an extra §eSOUL BONUS§r!",
	"stut.r8.6": "You should note that you can not consume souls that are stored in a can,",
	"stut.r8.7": "Those you simply need to collect in order to win the gamemode.",
	"stut.r8.8": "Anyway, The §eSOUL BONUS§r you get is different for every soul type.",
	"stut.r8.9": "The soul of §aKINDNESS§r, for example...",
	"stut.r8.10": "Actually, if you want to know more about souls, just click that info button over there!",

	"stut.r9.3.1": "In the front room of the lobby, there are §eGAMERULES§r that the admins can change.",
	"stut.r9.4": "Changing them can make the gameplay feel very different! For example...",
	"stut.r9.5": "You can enable a §eBORDER§r that gets smaller over time,",
	"stut.r9.6": "Or you can make players have more lives and §eRESPAWN§r after they die...",
